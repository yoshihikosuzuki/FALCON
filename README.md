Falcon: a set of tools for fast aligning long reads for consensus and assembly

The Falcon tool kit is a set of simple code collection which I use for studying
efficient assembly algorithm for haploid and diploid genomes. It has some back-end 
code implemented in C for speed and some simple front-end written in Python for
convenience.
